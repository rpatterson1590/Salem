          <h2>Pastor Eric Watts and First-Lady Dannielle Watts</h2>
          <p>
           Pastor Eric has been walking with the Lord since 2001 and has faithfully served as pastor of Salem since 2016. He and his wife, Dannielle (First Lady), have been blessed with over two decades of marriage. Dannielle was raised in church and has spent her whole life in God’s house, while Eric grew up attending PCG, where he developed a deep love for God from a young age. 
          </p>

          
          <p>
          Together, their greatest joy is serving the Lord and serving people. With a heart for Tallapoosa, they strive to be a light that points others to Christ. God has also blessed them with two children who are actively involved in ministry—Charity, who plays keyboard on the worship team, and Eric Jr., who serves faithfully on the drums.
